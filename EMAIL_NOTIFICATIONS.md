  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Development Team',
    description: 'Our awesome development team',
    notificationEmails: [
      'manager@company.com',
      'hr@company.com',
      'team-lead@company.com'
    ]
  })
});
```

### Testing Email Configuration

```javascript
// Test if email service is working
const testResponse = await fetch('/notifications/test-connection');
const result = await testResponse.json();

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Email service is ready!');
} else {
  console.log('Email service needs configuration');
}
```

### Sending a Test Email

```javascript
// Send a test notification
const testEmail = await fetch('/notifications/test', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: 'your-email@example.com',
    groupName: 'My Test Group'
  })
});
```

## Running the Application

1. Set up your `.env` file with email credentials
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
3. The email service will automatically initialize and verify the connection
4. Look for the console message: "Email service ready for sending notifications"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Email service not configured"**
   - Check your `.env` file exists and has correct email credentials
   - Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are set

2. **"Email service connection failed"**
   - Verify your email provider settings (host, port, security)
   - Check if 2FA is enabled and you're using an app password
   - Ensure less secure app access is enabled (for some providers)

3. **"Failed to send notification"**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify recipient email addresses are valid
   - Check email provider rate limits

### Debug Mode

The system logs detailed information about email operations:
- Connection status on startup
- Successful notification sends with message IDs
- Failed attempts with error details
- Bulk notification results (sent/failed counts)

## Security Notes

- Store email credentials securely in environment variables
- Use app passwords instead of account passwords
- Consider rate limiting for production environments
- Validate email addresses before adding to notification lists
- Monitor email service usage to avoid exceeding quotas

## Customization

### Email Templates
Email templates can be customized in `server/emailService.ts` in the `generateEmailContent` method.

### Notification Types
Add new notification types by:
1. Extending the `NotificationData` interface
2. Adding new cases to the email template generator
3. Implementing the notification triggers in your routes

### Email Providers
Switch email providers by updating the SMTP configuration in your `.env` file.
